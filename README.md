# ProjectRanker
|2016| Project I had to do for Comp Sci class.

Program should allow user to read from a file of sorts and then select themselves as a
voter, they can then select who they want in their group from greatest to least. User can save file, file auto saves to debug 
directory, then create a team based on that file. Program should be able to read from all the files with names that are on the 
student list that is loaded when the user first loads in the list. Program could be able to create teams based on an algorithm,
teams should have a similar rank to each other.
